# System Description and Purpose

The Tubungan Teachers Multi-Purpose Cooperative (TTMPC) Membership Profiling System is a digital platform designed to streamline and automate the cooperative’s member management and registration processes. The system enables TTMPC staff to efficiently record, verify, and update member information through a secure and user-friendly web interface.

This system replaces the traditional manual profiling method with a centralized database, ensuring faster processing of applications, improved data accuracy, and better record retrieval. It also supports both admin and member functionalities — allowing members to register online while enabling the admin to verify, accept, or reject applications.

# Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a digital information system for the Tubungan Teachers Multi-Purpose Cooperative (TTMPC) that automates and streamlines the cooperative’s member application and profiling process.
