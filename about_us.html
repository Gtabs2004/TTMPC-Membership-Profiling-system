                            <p>
                                For more than three decades, the Tubungan Teachers Multi-Purpose Cooperative (TTMPC) has remained a pillar of support for educators and their families. What began as a small initiative rooted in the values of unity, trust, and shared purpose, has since evolved into a vibrant hub of financial services and community development. Over the years, we've grown not just in membership but also in impact—providing accessible loans, empowering savings programs, and fostering a culture of collective progress. TTMPC's journey reflects a lasting commitment to service, collaboration, and the collective advancement of every member.

                            <p>
                                Our cooperative continues to bring its mission to life through meaningful community outreach, such as the Gift Giving Activity held at Kuyot Elementary School. Led by passionate board members and guided by the theme "We Care, We Share, We Serve," this initiative reflects our shared commitment to compassion, generosity, and service. By extending a helping hand to children in need, TTMPC not only fulfills its mission but also inspires members to live out values that extend beyond its members—reaching communities, touching lives, and inspiring collective growth.
